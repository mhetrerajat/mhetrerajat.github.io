This is a curated space where I share and maintain an evolving list of papers and resources on Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), evaluation techniques, and intelligent agents.

## Surveys

- [A Survey of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223)
- [A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10981)
