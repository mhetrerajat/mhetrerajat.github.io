# Data Modeling


## Benefits of Data Modeling

- One is that no matter how data is structured, it must be functionally bound to the business that it helps support. In other words, semi-structured formats are neither a panacea nor an excuse to forgo the process of business validation. The second—and most important—is that a model is not simply the shape that data takes once uploaded to a database, but rather, the blueprint for business operations, without which it is impossible to build sustainable architectures.
- Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) emerged to enable users to analyze multidimensional data from multiple perspectives using complex queries.
- data warehouse snapshots many historical versions and aggregates volumes of data to satisfy various analytical needs.
