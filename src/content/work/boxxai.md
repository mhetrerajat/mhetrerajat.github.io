As the Founding Engineer, built ETL pipelines orchestrated using Airflow, alongside the development of campaign customization and tracking platform with Django and React. Also, designed an A/B Testing module for real-time experiments on customizable customer segments. Collaborated cross-functionally, to implement and deploy containerized RESTful APIs for data upload and recommendation delivery on Kubernetes. Additionally, architected robust data ingestion APIs on AWS for seamless data integration from heterogeneous data sources.

Enhanced the personalization model by transitioning from item-item collaborative filtering to integrating contextual features, incorporating user preferences, and assigning variable importance through a neural network-based architecture. Also, introduced a contextual multi-armed bandit approach to effectively address real-time user preferences and contextual factors, improving content delivery optimization. By incorporating impression discounting and dithering techniques, increased user exploration and the discovery of new products. Moreover, successfully deployed recommendation models on a Kubernetes cluster using Tensorflow Serving with versioning for seamless management.
