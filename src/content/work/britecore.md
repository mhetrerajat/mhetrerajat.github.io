Developed and optimized data-driven solutions to enhance performance, scalability, and accessibility. This included productizing Data Export APIs with AWS Step Functions and Lambda for ad-hoc data retrieval, integrating AWS QuickSight dashboards to drive a 13% revenue increase, and leading a transition to a multi-layer DataLake on S3 and Athena, cutting maintenance costs by 60%. I also built a cost-efficient ETL pipeline with Spark and EMR, using functional programming for modularity, and created a dynamic ingestion module that reduced manual effort by 70% and improved reporting accuracy by 50%.
