		Throughout my career, I've effortlessly worn multiple hats. From
		training over a billion-parameter model utlizing distributed GPUs, to
		leading two teams in creating an infinitely scalable and fault-tolerant
		Lakehouse for storing and querying terabytes of data. As a founding
		engineer, I scaled a personalized recommendation engine from scratch to
		generate over a million recommendations daily. I collaborated with
		cross-functional teams to tailor reporting solutions for enterprise
		needs. Additionally, I built a real-time personalized search engine,
		helping 100K users find parking spots effortlessly.
