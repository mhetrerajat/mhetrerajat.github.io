		Throughout my career, I've effortlessly worn multiple hats. From
		training over a billion-parameter model utlizing distributed GPUs, to leading two
		teams in creating an infinitely scalable and fault-tolerant Lakehouse
		for storing and querying terabytes of data. As a founding engineer, I
		scaled a personalized recommendation engine from scratch to generate
		over a million recommendations daily. I collaborated with
		cross-functional teams to tailor reporting solutions for enterprise
		needs. Additionally, I built a real-time personalized search engine,
		helping 100K users find parking spots effortlessly.
