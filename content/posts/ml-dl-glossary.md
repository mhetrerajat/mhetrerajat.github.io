## I.I.D. Assumption

I.I.D. stands for Independent and Identically Distributed. In the standard supervised learning setting, we assume that the training and test data are drawn independently from identical distributions. This is commonly called the IID assumption.

## Generalization

Generalization is a definition to demonstrate how well is a trained model to classify or forecast unseen data. Refers to your model's ability to make correct predictions on new, previously unseen data as opposed to the data used to train the model.
